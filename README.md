# Titanic_Viz
A visualization is created using the Titanic dataset
## Summary:
The demographics of the people who either died or survived when the Titanic crashed is shown in this visualization. 
Survivors had more fares, higher ticket fares and lower passenger class. As far as age is concerned, older females and younger men survived more.

## Design:
### Initial design:
A stacked bar chart showing fares v/s passenger class stacked by gender can show how fare prices varied by passenger class for both men and women. 
A bubble chart showing age v/s passenger class stacked by gender can show the distribution of average age for the various passenger classes by gender.
Both of these can be made to transition using an animation based on whether they were dead or they survived.
Color was used as a visual encoding to differentiate between male and female categories. 

### Second attempt:
To allow user to pause animation and play it again as per will, two buttons were added.

## Feedback:
### Initial feedback:
Transition is too fast to interpret anything.

### Second attempt feedback:
•	What do you notice in the visualization?
    Female survivors are more than male survivors except for class 1
    Female in class 2 have been the least casualties
•	What questions do you have about the data?
    I am not sure how the Fare value fits in the graph
•	What relationships do you notice?
    Passenger class 2 are relatively younger
    Survivors are more in class 1, while the dead are almost equal. This indicates, class 1 had more people than the other classes
•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
    Most people that are dead are males in all classes
•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
    Fare value in the graph
