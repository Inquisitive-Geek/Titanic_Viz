# Titanic_Viz
A visualization is created using the Titanic dataset
## Summary:
The demographics of the people who either died or survived when the Titanic crashed is shown in this visualization. 
Survivors had more fares, higher ticket fares and lower passenger class. As far as age is concerned, older females and younger men survived more.

## Design:
### Initial design:
A stacked bar chart showing fares v/s passenger class stacked by gender can show how fare prices varied by passenger class for both men and women. 
A bubble chart showing age v/s passenger class stacked by gender can show the distribution of average age for the various passenger classes by gender.
Both of these can be made to transition using an animation based on whether they were dead or they survived.
Color was used as a visual encoding to differentiate between male and female categories. 

## Feedback:
### Initial feedback:
Transition is too fast to interpret anything.
